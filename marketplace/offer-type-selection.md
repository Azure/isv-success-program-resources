# Commercial marketplace

## Get help selecting the right transactable offer type

There are three transactable offer types in the Azure Marketplace.

- Virtual Machines offers 
- SaaS offers 
- Azure Managed Application offers

[This document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/marketplace-commercial-transaction-capabilities-and-considerations#transact-overview) helps you understand some of the differences.

### SaaS offers
